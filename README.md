# Care Car Insurance

This project for The Tech Academy was to demonstrate our ability to create a database first MVC application that utilized ASP.NET and C# to calculate quotes for car insurance. There were a number of variables that would affect price, including age of the driver, age of the car, how many tickets they've received, and if they wanted Full or Liability coverage.
